C Real-Time Ray Tracer
==============

By Aaron Fritz

This is a program I started near the end of March 2015. The original goal was to create a well-organized, modular ray tracer which improved upon the C++ version previously written. This ray tracer was the first one to provide functionality for soft shadows, and I find that to be a great improvement for realism. 

It does not (yet) allow for textures, but that would not be too difficult to add. The majority of the code already exists in another C++ ray tracer. I may or may not add to this ray tracer and instead work on another C++ version.

The code compiles with Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 7. It should all work with GCC, too, but I haven't been able to get SDL to reference properly yet. Requires the 'library' and 'include' references to the SDL library (which I haven't included. Maybe I should).
